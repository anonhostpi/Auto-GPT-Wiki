1. Open a PR
1. Be respectful of your reviewers and fix the things discussed

## General Rules

1. Only make one conceptual change per PR. I don't care if you're internal, external, or Toran himself. You must follow this.
1. Your tests must pass to merge.
1. You must retain backward compatibility for user-facing changes or have an announcement announcing the changes in advance.
1. You must give and get real reviews. 
1. You must not reduce the coverage by more than 5% overall.

### The Pull Request Body

Externally, we enforce a strict requirement of filling out the PR details.
