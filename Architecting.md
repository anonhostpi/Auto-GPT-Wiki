# 4 May 2023 ALERT: HyperDrive Engaged! ðŸš€

We are (as of yesterday) RE-ARCHITECTING the core of AutoGPT

This requires tight coordination.

If you're contributing to this project (e.g. have PRs stuck in the pipeline):
- We're sorry to create suffering (but think this is for the Greater Good)
- You're likely aware that the core is a mess and NEEDS re-architecting
- So we hope you understand that this needs to be done
- Please be patient and work with us on this
- We're doing our best

How to move forwards? How to involve?

Best way is to engage with the re-arch, or sit it out and wait for the dust to settle.


# Engaging in the re-arch

- Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/autogpt)

- If you know what you're doing and feel you are able to accelerate our progress:
    - DM pi#8377 and ask for a Contributor badge
        - say who you are (link your github etc.)
        - say what you're doing / would like to do
        - if you've got a PR in the pipeline, link it

    During this re-architecture phase we need senior devs.  
    A lot of planning has already been done.  Read through the #re-arch channel first.
    Once the dust has settled we'll be more able to help junior devs learn the ropes.  


# Non re-arch contribution (and/or waiting for dust to settle)

- If you have contributions in the pipeline
    - We'll be aware of your PR
    - If you wish to expedite it, please calculate whether you think it's in the best interests of the project to expedite, and if so connect over the Discord

- If you're enthusiastic to participate but it's all rather bewildering:
    - Please connect with other devs in the channels, and engage
    - Please be patient with us as we get the core into a shape and exit hyperdrive

- If you see a way we can be improving our process do let us know, and please prefer to work with the Discord channels.
