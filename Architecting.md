# 4 May 2023 ALERT

We are currently RE-ARCHITECTING the core of AutoGPT

If you're contributing to this project:
- We're sorry to create suffering (but think this is for the Greater Good)
- You're likely aware that the core is a mess and NEEDS re-architecting
- So we hope you understand that this needs to be done
- Please be patient and work with us on this
- We're doing our best

How to move forwards? How to involve?

Best way is to engage with the re-arch, or sit it out and wait for the dust to settle.


# Engaging in the re-arch

- Join Discord

- DM pi#8377 and ask for a Contributor badge
    - say who you are (link your github etc.)
    - say what you're doing / would like to do
    - if you've got a PR in the pipeline, link it

- Please only do this if you feel you have something significant to contribute
