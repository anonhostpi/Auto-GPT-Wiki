Warm Welcome to Our Communication Channels! 🎉

We're thrilled to have you here, and we're eager to share our communication best practices with you! We use Discord for our lively chats and GitHub as our trusty project management tool.


# Conventions

- Please put things in the most sensible place
    If we all do this we're golden

- Code-chunks (within a line) use ` either end of your code

- Code-blocks (multiline) use ```python
    - then ``` to end the block
    - this way you'll get beautiful syntax hilighting

- Use Discord Timestamps for scheduling https://r.3v.fi/discord-timestamps/

- If it helps someone else, react 👍 to acknowledge you've read something

- If you want to spawn a thread (and can't) ask a community mod


# When to Discord vs GitHub -- Guidelines

Here's a friendly guideline to help you navigate our communication channels effectively:

- First off, common sense wins!

- If it's relevant for more than 24-48 hours, skip Discord and head straight to GitHub.

- Our goal is to foster a more transparent, equitable, efficient, and open style of communication. That's why we love asynchronous conversations (like those on GitHub) over synchronous ones (like Discord or calls). Here's why:

- 🤔 Asynchronous chats give everyone time to process and contribute thoughtfully to the topic or issue at hand.

- ⏳ They can easily span a longer time period, unlike calls, which have time limitations.

- 🌍 Asynchronous communication is inclusive – anyone can join at any time, even if you didn't know who the relevant parties were beforehand.

- 📞 You can effortlessly transition from asynchronous chats to calls if needed, but the reverse is more challenging.

- 🔍 Conversations are easily searchable and stored for future reference, unlike calls.

- 📖 Catching up on an asynchronous conversation is more efficient and easier than watching a video or reading a transcript.

- 💆‍♀️ Discord can sometimes create anxiety due to the sheer volume of messages. Asynchronous chats on GitHub help separate the "good to know" from the "needed right now."

- 📝 Remember, for items that are useful for more than 1 month, we encourage you to use documentation.


We hope this friendly guide helps you embrace our communication culture, and we can't wait to see you flourish in our community! 🌟
