üéÆ Using our Discord 

We use a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/autogpt) for our users and our dev-team.

If you're stuck, look down the users-list for a community-mod and chat with them.

Discord is great for information that is more transient:
- touching base and chatting with other users / devs
- getting help / figuring out problems together
- discussing ideas
- hanging out in the video-conference rooms
- discussing even advanced dev topics

GitHub is great for more-persistent information.
- filing a bug / feature-request issue (after you've used Discord to discuss)
- contributing persistent information to a pull-request (please still prefer to keep chat on Discord)
- MAKING a pull-request

Do your best to figure out where to engage. We're trying to figure it out too.


# Discord Conventions & Tips

- If you're contributing, please align your nick-in-this-server with your GitHub username, and put your timezone  
    e.g. fooNickname -> myGitHubName (GMT+3)  
    UserSettings -> Profiles -> ServerProfiles  

- Please put things in the most sensible place
    If we all do this we're golden

- Code-chunks (within a line) use ` either end of your code

- Code-blocks (multiline) use ```python
    - then ``` to end the block
    - this way you'll get beautiful syntax hilighting

- Use Discord Timestamps for scheduling https://hammertime.cyou/en-GB

- If it helps someone else, react üëç to acknowledge you've read something

- If you want to spawn a thread (and can't) ask a community mod

- We use THREADS.
    - If you're in a channel and want to see the threads, there's a #üí¨ icon on the top right of your Discord window.
    - Click it to see all the threads
    - You can JOIN a thread (right click and 'join')
        - This means the thread appears under the channel, and you can see conversation in it!

- If you want your DMs alongside channels-view, use the Desktop Discord client and WebUI together
